**SimpleHAL** is a clone of [MegaHAL](http://megahal.alioth.debian.org/), the conversational simulator originated by Jason Hutchens. It is implemented by using plain python. Not attention to duplicate the MegaHAL, SimpleHAL try to simplify the [original approach described here](http://megahal.alioth.debian.org/How.html) as simple as possible via the python hight-level language.
